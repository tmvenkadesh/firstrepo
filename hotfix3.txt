this third hotfix to check remote branchs in details
there is remote branch tracking options or tracker in local which will maintain state or remote branch until it communicates to remote network
git fetch will udpate all remote tracking branching tracking withoug distrubing current local branchs
rebase testing is going to be peformed
rebase is just to clean history, same can be done with merging command also
however if you rebase the code with master, history will be shown in one line instead of branch
we will learn more about rebase further into the code
